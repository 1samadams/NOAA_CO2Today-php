This setup uses PHP to fetch the data from the NOAA server and then serves it to the frontend, avoiding CORS issues.

Save the PHP script (fetch_co2_data.php) in your server directory.
Save the HTML file and ensure it points to the correct path for the PHP script.
Open the HTML file in your browser.
